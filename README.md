# KCL work experience R workshop



**Description**

Bioinformatics analyses require skills that include extensive database management, query and analysing these data. Learning to code is a key skill in this field; there are different coding languages and here we will explore `R`. 
Just remember that once you learn one coding language, the skills are transferable, also learning to code is similar to learn a new language, there is a learning curve so be gentle. In this short session we will see the basis of coding in R, so that you can hopefully, continue the learning process after this experience. 

Why R? 

`R` is a freely distributed and widely used programing language and environment for statistical computing, data analysis and graphics. It is open source , widely-used and powerful programming language.
`RStudio` is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace managemen.
